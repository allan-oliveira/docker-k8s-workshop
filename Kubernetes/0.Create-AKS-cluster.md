# Using AKS

## Setup the cluster

We will be using the Azure CLI to create/interact with AKS so we need to ensure we are setup correctly.

You can list the subscriptions you have access to using:

```txt
az account list -o table
```

**Ensure the IsDefault is true for the account you want to use for this exercise**

If you need to change the default you can do this with:

```txt
az account set -s <subscriptionId>
```

We may need to register the container services resource provider

To check if you need to register the resource provider you can run:

```txt
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerService --query "registrationState"
```

If you do not see *"Registered"* then you will need to register the provider using the command below - if your provider is already registered you can jump straight to creating the cluster

```txt
az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService
```

The registration of the provider happens in the background so we need to check it has succeeded before continuing - it can take a few minutes to complete (check the status periodically)

```txt
az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerService --query "registrationState"
```

### Creating the cluster

First we create the resource group

```cmd
az group create -n k8s-workshoprg -l eastus2
```

We can now create our cluster

```txt
az aks create -n k8s-workshop -g k8s-workshoprg -k 1.15.7 -s Standard_D2s_v3 -c 2 --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets --enable-managed-identity --generate-ssh-keys --location eastus2
```

We are leaving the rest of the options default - in this command we are specifying the K8s version we want and 2 nodes using the VMSS approach (rather than availability sets) and we're telling Azure to create and manage a service principal identity for us. 

This operation usually takes between 6-10 mins to complete but can take up to 15-20

If you see an error during the cluster creation you may need to try the command again after 30s (the service principal propagation can take a few seconds).
If the creation keep on failing we may need to create the service principal in a separate step - see below

### Creating service principal separately

Using the azure cli (or cloud shell)

Run
```cmd
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment --name myAKSServicePrincipal
```
This will output some information similar to this

```cmd
{
  "appId": "0f691fec-5fe6-47ed-aa3a-b492b8d4592f",
  "displayName": "myAKSServicePrincipal",
  "name": "http://myAKSServicePrincipal",
  "password": "<secret>",
  "tenant": "<redacted>"
}
```

If this step is failing, its likely you don't have permissions to create service principals on your subscription. Either switch to a different subscription or free trial (or ask the organiser if there are any Azure passes available)

Copy the appId and password so you can use it in the next step

Now you should be able to run your cluster creation command with this instructions
Using a command similar to below - **remember to substitute your own appId and password values**

First we create the resource group
```cmd
az group create -n k8s-workshoprg -l westeurope
```

Now the cluster
```
az aks create -n k8s-workshop -g k8s-workshoprg -k 1.15.7 -c 2 --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets  --generate-ssh-keys --service-principal <appId> --client-secret <password>
```

The cluster creation should begin and should finish within 10mins.
